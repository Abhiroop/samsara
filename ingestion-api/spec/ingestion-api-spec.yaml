  title: Samsara Ingestion APIs
  description: |
    This specification is for the Ingestion API. Not all paths will be
    reachable from the client as many handlers are for internal use only.
    Those one with the `internal` tag will be available only from the internal
    network setup and will be used for service management purposes.

      summary: |
        Send client generated events to `Samsara` processing pipeline
        The content has to be an array of valid events.

      description: |
        This handler is responsible for ingesting data coming for the clients
        services and devices. It should validate the payload received, and inject
        an additional attribute `receivedAt` with the system timestamp (in millis)
        on every event.

        Finally it is responsible to forwards individual events received to
        the back end queueing system which can be one of **Apache Kafka**,
        **Amazon Kinesis**, **Azure EventsHub** or the **stdout** console
        (for testing purposes).

        The key part of the API is to ensure that only valid events are accepted
        and once we give a successful reponse we need to be able to guarantee
        that these events will be persisted and then processed.

        **Optionally** the client can send a GZIP'd payload by providing
        the header **Content-Encoding: gzip**. the API should be able
        to handle both compressed and uncompressed data and select the
        right handler on a per request basis.
        *This request returns an empty body* check the status codes for more info.
        
        Example of a plain JSON payload:
        
        ```
        cat <<EOF | curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                        -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/v1/events" -d @-
        [
          {
            "timestamp": 1424444803463,
            "sourceId": "3aw4sedrtcyvgbuhjkn",
            "eventName": "user.clicked",
            "page": "orders",
            "item": "sku-1234"
          }, {
            "timestamp": 1424444804587,
            "sourceId": "3aw4sedrtcyvgbuhjkn",
            "eventName": "user.clicked",
            "page": "orders",
            "item": "sku-5433",
            "action": "remove"
          }
        ]
        EOF
        ```
        
        Example of a GZIP JSON payload:
        
        ```
        cat <<EOF | gzip | curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                                -H "Content-Encoding: gzip" \
                                -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/v1/events" \
                                --data-binary @-
        [
          {
            "timestamp": 1424444803463,
            "sourceId": "3aw4sedrtcyvgbuhjkn",
            "eventName": "user.clicked",

            "item": "sku-5433",
            "action": "remove"
          }

  /api-status:
    get:

      summary: This is the proble url used by the load-balancer for healthcheck.

      description: |
        This should return the state of the interal status flag which
        is controlled by `PUT /api-status`.
        By default the status should healthy and online (HTTP 200).

        Example:
        
        ```
        curl -i -XGET "http://localhost:9000/v1/api-status"
        
        { "status": "online" }
        ```

      responses:
        200:
          description: The service is healthy and online
          examples:
            application/json: { "status": "online" }

    put:

      summary: This internal path is used to set the service offline for maintenance reason.

      description: |
        This should control and internal 'status' flag. When set to 'offline'
        the `GET /api-status` request should return a `503` response.
        If flipped back to 'online' then `GET /api-status`
        should return `200` as normal.

        Example:
        
        ```
        curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -XPUT "http://localhost:9000/v1/api-status" \

  Events:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: "#/definitions/Event"

  Event:
    description: |
      The baisc structure of an event is made of only three properties
      `timestamp`, `sourceId` and `eventName`. However the api
      should be able to accept any additional 'facet'.

    properties:

      timestamp:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: Is the time of the event in milliseconds from EPOC.

      eventName:
        type: string
        description: |
          Is the name of the event. Typically a namespaced action terminating
          in Past simple. Valid examples are 'user.clicked',
          or 'app.module.load.failed'.

      sourceId:
        type: string
        description: |
          A unique identifier of the event source with high cardinality.
          It is important that this is a high cardinality value to ensure
          a uniform spreading of the load and avoid hotspots.
